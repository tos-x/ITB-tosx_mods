,Personality,Character guidelines for chatter,"Detritus
A civilian on Detritus who was caught on the sidelines of the earliest Vek attacks, Kate Shreeve was left orphaned, injured, and deafened. As she recovered, she fine-tuned one of her late parents' inventions in order to hear again, and found that the receiver could detect the rumblings of underground Vek movement. Unable to sit by while the sounds of doom approached, she volunteered as a Mech Pilot despite her young age, and impressed her instructors with the unconventional acrobatics she employed in combat.","Pinnacle
A former operative for Pinnacle's clandestine Ministry of Strategic Science, Roland White worked alongside human and artificial agents to catalog and deal with strange phenomena across all of the islands and the ocean between. In his original timeline, the Ministry were the first to discover the Vek, and most of its agents were among the first casualties. As the survivors began fighting back with Mechs, they developed the reactive Titan Armor technology to limit further losses, a breakthrough which White carries with him to other timelines.","Detritus
Discovered in the Vek tunnels beneath Detritus, no one is sure what exactly Athena is; some strange turtle mutated by the island's runoff? A crashed-landed alien? A bioengineered warrior from another timeline? Athena herself has no memory of how she came to the island, but she is adept with machines and eager to drive off the Vek, despite a clumsiness that sometimes causes unwanted collateral damage. The overseers of the Pilot program quickly decided that she might as well be bumping into Vek, and turned her loose on the battlefield.","Pinnacle
Amelia Espada was a wandering soldier, touring the corporate islands in the calm before the Vek invasion. She became one of the first Mech pilots and enthusiastically sought out every combat mission she could. As the Vek gained ground and many of her fellow Pilots were lost, she realized that she needed whatever edge she could get, and began volunteering to test whatever new Mech capabilities the scientists could conceive. One successful prototype quickly became her favorite: a self-repairing liquid metal shell that kept her Mech in the fight long after it should have fallen to pieces, allowing her to fight more furiously than ever.","RST
A retired aviator with a long and distinguished career spanning multiple organizations on R.S.T. and Archive, Esther Martin was something of a legend throughout the corporate archipelago. When the Vek attacked, Martin was pulled in to the nascent Mech program and became one of the senior combat instructors, training the ragtag assortment of volunteer Pilots. No one was surprised when she insisted on leading them into battle as well, where her experience has been invaluable in keeping her squad alive.","RST
The extreme conditions on R.S.T. meant their medical response personnel needed to be hardy, effective, and determined, and Mark Savage was the best of their best. Before the Vek arrived he had already earned the callsign ""Doc Havoc"" for treating injuries in the violent and chaotic highland storms. The moniker held even more true as he transitioned to piloting a Mech and caring for his squadmates on hellish island battlefields. Though less gifted with repairing metal than flesh, Savage's iron composure, steady hand, and drive to protect have made him the heart and soul of his squad.","RST
An R.S.T. geological scout used to getting in and out of difficult terrain, Janet Walker spent the early portion of the Vek invasion operating Search and Rescue vehicles to save civilians. After seeing one too many scenes of destruction, she transferred into the Pilot program in the hopes of preventing such disasters, rather than dealing with their aftermath. Never happy standing still, Walker also acquired and experimented with a miniaturized Breach generator, altering it to create spatial breaches that would allow her to quickly teleport wherever she needed to be in moments of crisis.","Archive
Alain Mormont was an eager student of Old Earth history, especially the honor-bound warrior knights of the medieval era. Exploring and embracing their philosophies as she pored over old relics, the Vek invasion gave her the chance to prove that she could follow the same path and protect the helpless. She was accepted into the Pilot program, but a training exercise involving an uncontrolled temporal Breach left her inexplicably desynchronized from the timeline. Almost a year later, in a burst of light, she managed to regain temporal cohesion in front of a surprised group of maintenance engineers. Now she is learning to control her temporal drifting in order to quickly shift her Mech around the battlefield.","Archive
A distant relative of Detritus' CEO, Jai Chandra spent much of his life trying to distance himself from his family's privilege and prove himself on his own terms. He followed his father into physics, focusing on gravity-controlling devices with the potential to reshape the islands, possibly the world. The Vek invasion led the Chandras to alter their technology into Mech-mounted weapons, and Jai joined the Pilot program to see them used in defending their home.","Archive
While most Time Pods arrived from the sky, the one bearing Sen was unearthed deep in the forests of Archive. The mysterious being inside the Pod woke soon after it was opened, friendly and curious to learn the state of the world. Corporate scientists were at a loss to explain her appearance, or her seeming ability to alter the atmosphere and weather patterns around her, but they quickly noted her hatred of the destructive Vek, and passed her on to the Pilot program.","Detritus
A masked soldier known only by his call sign, Gargoyle has shared little of his past. Whispers spread among his fellow pilots that he had accidentally destroyed his original timeline while piloting a dangerous new superweapon derived from the Vek. Gargoyle's advanced biosuit has proven capable of interfacing with Mech systems, allowing him to siphon bioelectric energy from nearby targets directly into his Mech's reactor.","Pinnacle
Put into cryo-stasis long ago after an industrial accident, Ryan Frost was rudely reanimated when the Vek invasion disrupted power to the forgotten stasis facility. As a result, he now requires a special thermal suit to survive, which has done nothing to improve his view of his new situation. Lacking any other way to acquire such technology, he grudgingly volunteered as a Mech Pilot, and had his personal Mech retrofitted with specialized heat exchangers to ensure he stays cold and alive.","Unknown
A shrouded, nomadic being, the Stranger survived well past the fall of civilization in his original timeline. He stalked the post-apocalyptic jungles of his home island for years in salvaged Mechs, as the radioactive wasteland slowly changed him into something else. He eventually found and repaired a Time Pod, escaping the end of the world. Though he can no longer even remember his original form or name, his knowledge of the Vek is second to none.","Archive 
Dr. Andromeda McLear was an astronomer with Archive's Space Command, investigating deep space through observation satellites. The inexplicable Vek invasion confounded her ordered view of the world, and she transitioned to the Pilot program in large part to research them and whatever phenomena were responsible for their appearance. On the battlefield, she feeds enemy coordinates to her old colleagues so that the few remaining orbital defense satellites can be targeted at the Vek swarms.","Archive
A professional gambler from Archive, Earl Deckard made a living playing the odds. Though his integrity was somewhat in question, he was quick to spot and exploit any vulnerability his opponent showed him, a skill which the Pilot program found valuable. The former card sharp now focuses on winning the ultimate game: outwitting the Vek on the battlefield, using every cheap trick and unfair advantage he can find.","Archive
While Breach technology has provided hope against the Vek, the Corporations' understanding of it is still limited. As such, none of their scientists have been able to explain how an Old Earth warrior from the distant past stepped out of a Time Pod recovered from Archive. Declaring himself Sir George of Mormoth, he exhibited a surprising acceptance of the situation around him. The knight's discipline and tactical cunning made him a fast learner and, soon enough, a capable pilot for the giant suits of armor called Mechs. Now he wades into combat with the hope of saving this future and finding a path home.","Detritus
Simon Coil was fascinated by death. In particular, the sentient machines of Pinnacle, with their potential to be revived after physical destruction, seemed to Coil like the ultimate goal of humanity. The corporate intelligence agencies were vaguely aware of his attempts to reanimate and control deceased organics through advanced neurochemical stimulators; the arrival of the Vek led Coil to openly approach them and volunteer his experimental techniques for use on the Vek.","RST
Julia Takahashi spent her early life as a Corporate solider. When her term of service was up, she continued to utilize and develop her combat skills as a mercenary sharpshooter, joining a shadowy intra-island coalition. The pay was excellent, but the job soon began taking its toll on her conscience. The appearance of the Vek allowed Takahashi to apply her unerring aim to a less ambiguous set of targets, and she has been known to carry her personal sniper rifle with her into combat, making impossible shots from her Mech's cockpit.","Detritus
Office Tang was part of Detritus' corporate dispute department, which served as a pseudo-police force in charge of maintaining order across the island. Her harsh sense of justice was balanced by an equally fierce loyalty to her friends, and she was rising quickly through the ranks when the Vek invasion almost cost her an eye. Now scarred and out for vengeance, she wades into combat to exact retribution for humanity.","Detritus
Ezekiel Gray became the head of Detritus' Energy Division at a young age, recklessly pursuing experimental reactor technology to expand the Grid. A catastrophic meltdown left him irradiated and slowly dying; his attempts to find a cure for his condition resulted in unintended casualties and a prison sentence. However, his ruthlessness and skill have earned him a pardon in order to help defeat the Vek, and the core shielding found in Mechs actually slows his cellular decay. While he has little hope of surviving the war, Gray sees Breach technology as a chance to find other timelines where a cure might exist.","Pinnacle
A stage magician and gifted sleight-of-hand artist, Marika Prochazka came to the attention of the War Council after miraculously surviving a Vek attack on the venue she we was performing at. Deciding that her career as an entertainer was of little consequence if the Vek won, she applied herself to Mech training and soon earned a reputation for her almost supernatural ability to avoid certain death. When the smoke cleared, 'The Magnificent Mara' was always still standing, ready to continue the fight.","Pinnacle
A former Detritus scientist, Karl Schraeder relocated to Pinnacle in his pursuit of human-machine hybridization. He applied his extensive knowledge of A.C.I.D. to the creation of versatile, programmable nanites, which could integrate with and repair flesh and metal alike. After suffering grievous wounds during a Vek attack, Schraeder saw the nanites as his only chance to recover and rejoin the war effort, becoming the islands' first cyborg in the process. While there have been unexpected side-effects, he hopes to apply the technology towards rebuilding the islands, once the war is over.","RST
R.S.T.'s constantly-shifting geography made mapping the island difficult, until Alec Shaheen single-handedly founded the Corporate Cartography Society to gain a detailed understanding of the island, including the tunnels beneath it. Soon he was contracting with the other corporations as well, and the invasion brought new work in plotting Vek movements and locating their burrows. Eventually the work became too dangerous to do without a Mech; now Shaheen uses holographic mapping tech to create decoys as he surveys the battlefield terrain.",,"Pinnacle
Amelia Espada was a wandering soldier, touring the corporate islands in the calm before the Vek invasion. She became one of the first Mech pilots and enthusiastically sought out every combat mission she could. As the Vek gained ground and many of her fellow Pilots were lost, she realized that she needed whatever edge she could get, and began volunteering to test new Mech capabilities conceived by the scientist teams. One successful prototype quickly became her favorite: an emergency power regulator which amplified combat abilities in dire situations, allowing her to fight more furiously than ever."
